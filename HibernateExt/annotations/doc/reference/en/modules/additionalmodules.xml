  <title>Additional modules</title>

  <para>Hibernate Annotations mainly focus on persistence metadata. The
  project also have a nice integration with two Hibernate modules.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Hibernate Validator</title>

    <section>
      <title>Description</title>

      <para>Annotations are a very convenient and elegant way to specify
      invariant constraints for a domain model. You can, for example, express
      that a property should never be null, that the account balance should be
      strictly positive, etc. These domain model constraints are declared in
      the bean itself by annotating its properties. A validator can then read
      them and check for constraint violations. The validation mechanism can
      be executed in different layers in your application without having to
      duplicate any of these rules (presentation layer, data access layer).
      Following the DRY principle, Hibernate Validator has been designed for
      that purpose.</para>

      <para>Hibernate Validator works at two levels. First, it is able to
      check in-memory instances of a class for constraint violations. Second,
      it can apply the constraints to the Hibernate metamodel and incorporate
      them into the generated database schema.</para>

      <para>Each constraint annotation is associated to a validator
      implementation responsible for checking the constraint on the entity
      instance. A validator can also (optionally) apply the constraint to the
      Hibernate metamodel, allowing Hibernate to generate DDL that expresses
      the constraint. With the appropriate event listener, you can execute the
      checking operation on inserts and updates done by Hibernate. Hibernate
      Validator is not limited to use with Hibernate. You can easily use it
      anywhere in your application.</para>

      <para>When checking instances at runtime, Hibernate Validator returns
      information about constraint violations in an array of
      <classname>InvalidValue</classname> s. Among other information, the
      <classname>InvalidValue</classname> contains an error description
      message that can embed the parameter values bundle with the annotation
      (eg. length limit), and message strings that may be externalized to a
      <classname>ResourceBundle</classname> .</para>

      <title>Integration with Hibernate Annotations</title>

      <para>If Hibernate Validator
      (<filename>hibernate-validator.jar</filename>) is available in the
      classpath, Hibernate Annotations will integrates in two ways:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Constraints will be applied to the Data Definition Language.
          In other words, the database schema will reflect the constraints
          (provided that you use the hbm2ddl tool).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Before an entity change is applied to the database (insert or
          update), the entity is validated. Validation errors, if any, will be
          carried over through an
          <classname>InvalidStateException</classname>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>For entities free of validation rules, the runtime performance
      cost is null.</para>

      <para>To disable constraint propagation to DDL, set up
      <literal>hibernate.validator.apply_to_ddl</literal> to false in the
      configuration file. Such a need is very uncommon and not
      recommanded.</para>

      <para>To disable pre-entity change validation, set up
      <literal>hibernate.validator.autoregister_listeners</literal> to false
      in the configuration file. Such a need is very uncommon and not
      recommanded.</para>

      information.</para>

    <title>Hibernate Search</title>

    <section>
      <title>Decription</title>

      <para>Full text search engines like <productname>Apache
      Lucene</productname> are a very powerful technology to bring free
      text/efficient queries to applications. If suffers several mismatches
      when dealing with a object domain model (keeping the index up to date,
      mismatch between the index structure and the domain model, querying
      mismatch...) Hibernate Search indexes your domain model thanks to a few
      annotations, takes care of the database / index synchronization and
      brings you back regular managed objects from free text queries.
      Hibernate Search is using <ulink url="http://lucene.apache.org">Apache
      Lucene</ulink> under the cover.</para>

      <title>Integration with Hibernate Annotations</title>

      <para>Hibernate Search integrates with Hibernate Annotations
      transparently provided that hibernate-search.jar is present in the
      classpath. If you do not wish to autoregister Hibernate Search event
      listeners, you can set
      <literal>hibernate.search.autoregister_listeners</literal> to false.
      Such a need is very uncommon and not recommanded.</para>

      information.</para>
