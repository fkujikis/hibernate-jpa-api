 * defined using generics to specify the element type, the associated target entity class
 * does not need to be specified; otherwise it must be specified.
 *
 * Every many-to-many association has two sides, the owning side and the non-owning, or inverse,
 * side. The join table is specified on the owning side. If the association is bidirectional,
 * either side may be designated as the owning side.
 *
 * The same annotation elements for the OneToMany annotation apply to the ManyToMany annotation.
