Hibernate Search
==================================================
Version: 3.2.2.beta, xx.02.2007

Description
-----------

Full text search engines like Apache Lucene(tm) are a very powerful technology to
bring free text/efficient queries to applications. If suffers several mismatches
when dealing with a object domain model (keeping the index up to date, mismatch
between the index structure and the domain model, ...)
Hibernate Search indexes your domain model thanks to a few annotations, takes
care of the index synchronization, brings you back managed objects from free text
queries.
Hibernate Search is using Apache Lucene(tm) under the cover.
