/**
 * This annotation specifies a primary key column that is used as a foreign key to join to another
 * table.
 *
 * It is used to join the primary table of an entity subclass in the JOINED mapping strategy to
 * the primary table of its superclass; it is used within a SecondaryTable annotation to join a
 * secondary table to a primary table; and it may be used in a OneToOne mapping in which the
 * primary key of the referencing entity is used as a foreign key to the referenced entity.
 *
 * If no PrimaryKeyJoinColumn annotation is specified for a subclass in the JOINED mapping
 * strategy, the foreign key columns are assumed to have the same names as the primary key
 * columns of the primary table of the superclass
