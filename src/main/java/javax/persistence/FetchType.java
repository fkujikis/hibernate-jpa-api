/**
 * Defines strategies for fetching data from the database.
 * The EAGER strategy is a requirement on the persistence provider runtime that data must
 * be eagerly fetched. The LAZY strategy is a hint to the persistence provider runtime that
 * data should be fetched lazily when it is first accessed. The implementation is permitted to
 * eagerly fetch data for which the LAZY strategy hint has been specified. In particular, lazy
 * fetching might only be available for Basic mappings for which property-based access is used.
